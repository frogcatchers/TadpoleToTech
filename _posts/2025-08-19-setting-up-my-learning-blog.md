## Welcome to My Learning Journey!

Today I set up this blog to document my IT learning experiences. Here's what I plan to cover:

## Learning Goals
- **Docker & Containerization**: Understanding container concepts and practical usage
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrating containers at scale
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automating testing and deployment
- **Cloud Technologies**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud basics

## Why Blog About Learning?
- **Reinforcement**: Writing about concepts helps solidify understanding
- **Reference**: Creating my own documentation for future use
- **Community**: Sharing experiences might help other learners
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrating continuous learning to potential employers

## What's Next?
My next post will be about setting up my local Docker environment and running my first containers.

Stay tuned!
