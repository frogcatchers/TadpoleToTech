Today I asked Claude.ai to help me come up with a strategy for learning both GitHub and Gitlab while using each to focus on different tasks.
Claude recommended a Split Strategy
GitHub (Public Face):

Polished learning blog
Showcase projects for employers
Open source contributions
Final, clean project repositories

GitLab (Learning Lab):

Messy experimental code
Private practice repositories
Complex CI/CD learning projects
Enterprise workflow simulation

Example Learning Projects for GitLab

Multi-stage CI/CD Pipeline - Build â†’ Test â†’ Security Scan â†’ Deploy
Kubernetes Deployment Project - With GitLab's K8s integration
Docker Registry Practice - Host your own container images
Infrastructure as Code - Terraform with GitLab CI
Security-First Development - Using GitLab's security features

This way I get the best of both platforms - GitHub for your professional presence and GitLab for advanced DevOps learning. Want me to help you plan specific projects for each platform?
