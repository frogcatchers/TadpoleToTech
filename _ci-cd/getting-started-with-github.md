# Getting Started with GitHub Actions

Today I'm beginning my CI/CD journey with GitHub Actions. Here's what I plan to learn and my initial setup.

## Learning Goals
- Understand what CI/CD is and why it's important
- Create my first GitHub Actions workflow
- Automate testing and deployment processes
- Learn YAML syntax for workflows

## What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that help teams deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.

## My First Workflow Plan
1. Set up a simple "Hello World" action
2. Create automated testing for a sample project
3. Add deployment automation to GitHub Pages

## Resources I'm Using
- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
