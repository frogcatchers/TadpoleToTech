# Getting Started with Docker

Today I'm beginning my Docker learning journey. Here's what I plan to cover and my initial setup.

## Learning Goals
- Understand what containers are and why they're useful
- Install Docker Desktop on my machine
- Run my first container
- Learn basic Docker commands

## What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

## Installation Plan
1. Download Docker Desktop
2. Verify installation with `docker --version`
3. Run the classic "Hello World" container

## Next Steps
- Install Docker Desktop
- Run my first container
- Document the process and any issues I encounter

## Resources I'm Using
- [Docker Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Docker Getting Started Tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
